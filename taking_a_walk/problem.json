  "description": "I took a walk around my neighborhood last week, and I took some photos. Unfortunately, most of them are of the sidewalk (I'm a really terrible photographer), so now I don't know where I went! For each photo, can you find me the first letter of the street it was taken on? (The first photo was at a school, so use the first letter of the short school name.) If you can find the streets, the letters should spell out a word, which you can submit as gunnHacks{the_word}. Make sure to submit the word in lowercase. Here are the photos I took: {{url_for(\"img.zip\")}}}",

You don't need any knowledge of Palo Alto sidewalks to solve this challenge.", "What other data do image files store, besides the visual image itself?"],
